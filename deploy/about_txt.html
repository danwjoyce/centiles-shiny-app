<h4>About / Warning</h4>
<p>This is an untested beta version (i.e. for experimenting with) and it has <b>not been validated against charts used in clinical practice</b>. It should not be relied upon as the sole means of calculating centiles for height or blood pressure in routine clinical practice.
</p>

<p>Operation is self-explanatory - input the child's parameters and the centiles get calculated
</p>

<p>
To view current data on a centile plot (in the Plot Tab), select the required plot in the drop-down box, and hit the ?Plot? button.
</p>
<p>
The Summary tab contains a text report for copying and pasting into letters, notes etc.
</p>

<p>Created using R, ggplot2, reshape and grid packages running in Shiny. I am happy to make the code freely available (e.g. if you want to port it to a more flexible platform, run it locally on an R/Shiny server)
</p>

<p>Email questions, suggestions etc.
